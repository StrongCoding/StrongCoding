# Daniel's Coding Journey 🚀
👋 Hey there! I’m Daniel, a passionate coder on a journey through the digital landscape. 🌐

## About Me
- 🚀 Started my coding adventure at 42Wolfsburg in March 2023.
- 💡 Always had an affinity for IT, but it wasn’t until recently that I dove headfirst into the world of programming.
- ⏰ Now, I’m spending over 40 hours a week coding, and time just flies by—I guess you could say I’m hooked! 💻
- 🧩 Solving problems is my jam, and my code keeps getting better week after week.
## Projects I’ve Tackled
- 📚 Created my own custom library with printf and get_next_line.
- 🛠️ Implemented essential C functions like memcpy, strcpy, strncpy, and even tackled string splitting.
- 🖥️ Crafted a Minishell in C and dabbled in raycasting for a game.
- 🧠 Explored threads and solved the classic philosopher’s problem.
- 🌐 Ventured into C++ and built a webserver.
## What’s Next?
- 🎮 On weekends, I tinker with frontend development and explore the fascinating world of Godot Engine.
## Let’s Connect!
- 📬 Feel free to reach out on LinkedIn or drop me an email—I’d love to chat about code, tech, or anything else! 🤝
