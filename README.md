Hello,
I'm Daniel and started my coding journey in march 2023 at 42Wolfsburg.
I was always intersted in coding and IT, but never dived deep into it since then.
Before 42 I programmed microprocessors in assembler and did some scripting for a gaming community.
Now I'm coding more than 40hrs a week and really loving it. Time is flying by and I love to solve problems!

At the moment I'm focusing on 42 projects. My code is improving from week to week.

On the weekends I did some frontend stuff for discovering and want to learn more about Godot Engine.
